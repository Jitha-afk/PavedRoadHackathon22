## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
Microsoft distributes software and operating system to billions of customers across the globe. A key contributor to Microsoft’s success is the trust that we have built with our customers by continuously improving the security posture of our products. Developers within Microsoft understand the importance of writing secure code and following continuous Security Development Lifecycle but they spend huge amount of time in keeping their code secure. On top, there are numerous reactive controls from build to post release which validate and flag security gaps. Mitigation of these gaps needs rework and developer bandwidth which is counterproductive. Secure Development Framework (SDF) aims to provide a paved road approach to developers with highly configurable and reusable code libraries / packages / Plugins for various security scenarios. This effort is aimed at providing a Secure Development Framework, which developers can start using right from the Design Phase of SDL.

- IDEAL: *This section is used to describe the desired or “to be” state of the process or product. At large, this section should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.*
- REALITY: *This section is used to describe the current or “as is” state of the process or product.*
- CONSEQUENCES/IMPACT: *This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon. This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth.*
  - Reduces cognitive load and time for developers to implement security in code allowing them to focus on business logic, solving problems and innovate rather than trying to determine if a vulnerability exists due to different code implementation practices.
  - Reduces load on build and post release validations rather these controls can focus on above baseline vulnerabilities. 
  - Code is secure by birth and stays secure as Born Secure Coding Framework makes continuous improvements.

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
*This section is used to describe potential solutions.*
*Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been 
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.*

- - - ### Project template imbibed with Authentication
        Several predefined project templates are installed with Visual Studio. These templates, such as the ASP.NET Web Application, Console application and Class Library templates, are available to choose from when you create a new project.
        
        The proposal is to create a new template(s) that can be installed as add-ons with visual studio which has authentication implementation in place. First release, will be targeted towards ASP.Net Core Web API, ASP.Net Core Web App which are most frequently used, and authentication and authorization principles are most applicable.

- - - - #### Benefits
        - Easy to use.  
        - The groundwork needed to create a new project template is well tried and tested and also recommended by the Visual Studio team.
        - No worry about maintaining multiple versions. If any NuGets are used in the template, the versioning task falls on the NuGet package owners and not on the templates. Hence easy to maintain.
        - No learning curve for the end user to use. 
        - No separate documentation is needed as the code can contain elaborate comments. 
        - The same template can have all the recommended authentication mechanisms. 

## ⛓️ Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>
- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
*Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what the project can achieve in the future.*

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
*These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development 
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.*

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
*Add notes about how to use the system.*
